# Code
- The data query process involves loading and manipulating a dataset using the pandas library in Python. The dataset, "FINAL_USO.csv," is read into two dataframes, 'train' and 'test.' The test set is then reduced to the first 100 rows. Data cleaning is performed by removing any rows with missing values. The features ('Open') and target ('Adj Close') columns are extracted and transformed into NumPy arrays. The scikit-learn library is utilized to create a linear regression model ('mdl') using the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared score on the test set. Finally, the true and predicted values are visualized through a histogram using matplotlib.
